## Project Overview

This project is a React-based web application that provides a job listing platform. It allows users to filter job listings based on various criteria such as roles, number of employees, experience, and salary expectations. The front end is built with React, utilizing Redux for state management to handle application state and asynchronous API calls.

### Live Demo

You can view a live demo of this project deployed on Netlify: [Candidate Application System](https://candidate-application-system.netlify.app/).

### Features

- Job listings with infinite scroll
- Dynamic filters for job search (roles, experience, salary, etc.)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile views

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you will need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. To install these, you can follow the [Node.js download guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://yourrepository.git
cd your-project-folder
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for production

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
